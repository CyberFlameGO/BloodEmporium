# Blood Emporium
[Releases](https://github.com/IIInitiationnn/BloodEmporium/releases)

A program to automatically level the Bloodweb in the game Dead by Daylight.

### Overview
- Automatically selects optimal nodes on the Bloodweb based on user-configured preferences
- Uses game icon files to identify nodes on the Bloodweb
- Should not be bannable since there are no interactions with the game's memory or process
    - Use at your own risk! (maybe one day we'll ask a dev if it's okay)

### Configuration
- coming soon

### Features
- Uses a cost algorithm to determine optimally how to select maximal preferred unlockables and minimal undesirable ones
- Allows user to configure which unlockables are preferred or undesirable
- Completely automatic and hands-free

### Issues
- Icon packs with similar-looking icons are more likely to cause incorrect object recognition, which may result in
  incorrect or suboptimal selection
